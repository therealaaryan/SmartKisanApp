# SmartKisanApp
This is my Semester 4 project

This app allows farmers to sell and buy various commodities such as cattle, eqipment etc. The data thus entered via profile page and sell page shall then be stored in a RealTime Database in FireBase.

User shall require internet connection for this app to work.
